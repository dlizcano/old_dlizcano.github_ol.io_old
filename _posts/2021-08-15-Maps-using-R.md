# R as mapping tool. 


R has added more tols to make beautiful maps, and has evolved from a simple GIS tool to a very cappable software to make maps. New packages as sf, mapview, and tmap are game changers, extending R capabilities to make excellent maps.

This is one example from the papper [Elevation as an occupancy determinant of the little red brocket deer (Mazama rufina) in the Central Andes of Colombia](https://doi.org/10.15446/caldasia.v43n2.85449). https://doi.org/10.15446/caldasia.v43n2.85449
