## The new system to evaluate researchers by Colciencias.

Intrigued and trying to understand how the new ranking system for research groups look like in Colombia. I was looking for some details [here.0(http://www.colciencias.gov.co/articulos/medici-n-de-grupos-de-investigaci-n-desarrollo-tecnol-gico-yo-innovaci-n-y-recocimiento-de)
Just recently [Colciencias](http://www.colciencias.gov.co) changed their silly policy publishing scanned PDF files. However it is still annoying that [Colciencias](http://www.colciencias.gov.co) is still publishing their results in PDF tables very hard to read by a computer. 
Asking if re results are available in another format different to PDF they argue "security" reasons. 

#### Here what they answer to my petition.

Now I have to find the time to to make thousand clicks to convert the PDF with the results in something readable by a computer. I try before converting the PDF to text, but the result is a crazy mess. 

I will appreciate any comment.
