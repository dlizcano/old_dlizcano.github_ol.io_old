## Mountain Tapir Distribution
Taking as excuse the new package [rMaps](https://github.com/ramnathv/rMaps). I wanted to plot my old points for the Mountain tapir. I hope this could serve as a starting point for a new collaborative project.

#### Why to Update the Mountain Tapir Distribution?

- The information available as map in the red list has more than 10 years old. 
  [Just take a look to the red list info for mountain tapir](http://maps.iucnredlist.org/map.html?id=21473).
- In the last 10 years researchers have studied mountain tapirs at new locations.
- New powerful tools to build robust distribution models have been developed. 

##### Those are some locations

Click on each point to see the type of evidence: hair, photo, footprint or faeces. 

#### The R code to make it

{% highlight css %}
require(rMaps)
fieldpoints_Diego<-read.csv("C:\\Users\\Diego\\Documents\\CodigoR\\Tapirus_SDM\\data\\T_pin.csv")

cord<-c(2.5,-73) #central location in the map
map3 <- Leaflet$new()
map3$setView(cord, zoom = 6)
map3$tileLayer(provider = 'MapQuestOpen.OSM')#Stamen.TonerLite
# put the info over the clicking points
for (i in 1:nrow(fieldpoints)){
  binpop<-paste("<p>",as.character(fieldpoints[i,5]),
  as.character(fieldpoints[i,6]), as.character(fieldpoints[i,9]),"</p>", sep=" " )  
map3$marker(c(fieldpoints[i,8], fieldpoints[i,7]), bindPopup = binpop)
  }
{% endhighlight %}
