I work as professional-services consultant, with a focus on strategic matters around ecology and biodiversity conservation. I am especially interested in helping companies to take science and data based decisions. 

Most recently, Iâ€™ve been working on monitoring wildlife and understanding deforestation. This is also the focus of my consulting practice.
