I am proud member of the IUCN/SSC [Tapir Specialist Group (TSG)](http://www.tapirs.org/), Admin of the projects ["Fauna de Norte de Santander"](http://www.inaturalist.org/projects/fauna-de-norte-de-santander) in iNaturalist, and [Fauna of Manabi](https://faunamanabi.github.io/). I am editor and webmaster of [Mammalogy Notes](https://mammalogynotes.org), the journal of the Colombian Mammal Society. I also enjoy planning and taking pictures and making and flying kites.
