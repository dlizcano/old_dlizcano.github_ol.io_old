I am Biologist interested in mammal ecology and conservation. I have extensive field experience working in the tropics. Recently I moved to the US with [my wife ](http://www.clfs.umd.edu/biology/faganlab/people/alvarez.html) I enjoy learn about R and computers. I am also an avid photographer. 

##Work
I work as professional-services consultant, with a focus on strategic matters around ecology and biodiversity conservation. I am especially interested in helping companies science and data based decisions. 


Most recently, Iâ€™ve been working on monitoring wildlife using occupancy modelling and understanding deforestation by applying Bayesian statistics. This is also the focus of my consulting practice.


This site hosts: My blog, a description of my research interests, social media links and other stuff I use to spend my time.
