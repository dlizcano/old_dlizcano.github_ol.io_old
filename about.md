I am Biologist interested in mammal ecology and conservation. I have extensive field experience working in the tropics. Recently I moved from the US to Ecuador to work in a vertebrate inventory project. I enjoy learning about R and computers. I am also an avid photographer.

## Work
I work as professional-services consultant, with a focus on strategic matters around ecology and biodiversity conservation. I am especially interested in helping companies, organizations and governments to make science and data based decisions.   


Most recently, I have been working on monitoring wildlife using occupancy modeling and understanding deforestation by applying Bayesian statistics. This is also the focus of my consulting practice.  


This site hosts my blog, a description of my research interests, social media links and other things I use to spend my time.
