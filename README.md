# Diego J. Lizcano website
**This repositorie contains the files for my [personal website](http://dlizcano.github.io/about/)**

Made using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and the theme [Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)

## Minimal Mistakes is all about:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers. 
* Minimal embellishments -- content first.
* Optional large feature images for posts and pages.
* Simple and clear permalink structure.
* [Custom 404 page](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/404.html) to get you started.
* Stylesheets for Pygments and Coderay [syntax highlighting](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/articles/code-highlighting-post/) to make your code examples look snazzy.
