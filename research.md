In most of my research I have studied mountain tapirs, my favourite species. 

##Research Interests:

* Mammal ecology.
* Defaunation. 
* Hunting sustainability. 
* Occupancy modelling.

##Past Work
I worked with the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network as visiting scientist on a method to monitoring terrestrial vertebrates as tool for conservation. In this project I collaborated with [Dr. Jorge Ahumada ](http://www.teamnetwork.org/user/376) and Johanna Hurtado analyzing the TEAM's data set for Volcan Barva.
